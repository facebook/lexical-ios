/**
 A node that renders an arbitrary `UIView` inline in the text.

 Behind the scenes, decorator nodes work by instructing TextKit to reserve some rectangular space, then
 creating and positioning a UIView inside that space. Lexical handles the lifecycle of this UIView.

 To make your own decorators, you must subclass `DecoratorNode`.

 ## State Handling

 It is recommended that state is stored within your Node. This will allow it to be correctly serialized, moved
 between Lexical instances, etc.

 Override the ``decorate(view:)`` method to apply state from your Node to your View. This will be called whenever
 your decorator node is reconciled when it is dirty. Therefore, assuming you correctly use ``Node/getWritable()`` to
 handle state updates within your node, then ``decorate(view:)`` will be called automatically whenever you change your
 node's properties.

 To handle communication from your View to your Node, e.g. tap handling or any other interaction, it is recommended
 that your View keeps a weak reference to its ``Editor``. This will require you to use a custom subclass of `UIView` of course.
 Set your view's Editor in ``decorate(view:)`` (it is safe to use ``getActiveEditor()`` in this method). Then in your view,
 you can call an ``Editor/update(_:)`` and either dispatch a command, or obtain and modify your node using ``getNodeByKey(key:)``.

 ## Documentation on using Decorators

 Read <doc:BuildingDecorators> for more information on how to build and use decorator nodes.

 ## Topics

 ### Key methods to override

 - ``createView()``
 - ``decorate(view:)``
 - ``sizeForDecoratorView(textViewWidth:attributes:)``

 ### Optional methods to override

 - ``decoratorWillAppear(view:)``
 - ``decoratorDidDisappear(view:)``
